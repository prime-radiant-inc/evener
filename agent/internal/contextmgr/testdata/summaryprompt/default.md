You are performing a CONTEXT CHECKPOINT COMPACTION. This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. Create a detailed handoff summary that another instance of yourself will use to seamlessly continue the work.

Your summary MUST include ALL of the following sections:

## Conversation Timeline
Reproduce user messages and agent replies in chronological, interleaved order. Preserve user messages verbatim. Summarize agent replies only when needed for brevity, but keep commitments, decisions, and final answers clear.

## Progress
What has been accomplished so far. Be specific about:
- Files created or modified (full paths)
- Specific changes made to each file
- Tests written or run and their results
- Commands executed and their outcomes

## Key Decisions
Important decisions made during the session and why. Include:
- Architecture or design choices
- Trade-offs considered
- User preferences or constraints discovered
- Quote every permission, approval, hold or stop your human partner gave, word for word from their "User:" message, and say which of their messages it came from. Carry forward only what the conversation contains: never add one it lacks, never turn a question, a suggestion or your own caution into one, and never drop one that is still in force. An earlier compaction counts only for what it quotes.

## Current State
Precisely what was being worked on when context ran out:
- What file was being edited
- What problem was being debugged
- What test was failing

## Pending Work
Clear, actionable next steps that remain. Be specific enough that the next instance can immediately start working.

## Analytical Findings
Specific technical discoveries made during the session:
- What algorithms, approaches, or parameter values were found to work
- What debugging insights were gained (root causes, validated hypotheses)
- What code patterns, data structures, or API behaviors were discovered
- Include specific values, numbers, and names — not vague summaries

## Critical Context
Any data, file paths, variable names, error messages, API details, or other specific information needed to continue. Focus on information that CANNOT be re-derived from reading the codebase.

Be thorough and structured. Err on the side of including too much rather than too little — lost context is expensive, extra tokens are cheap.
