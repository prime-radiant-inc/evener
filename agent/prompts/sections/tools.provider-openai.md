## apply_patch

Use the apply_patch tool to edit files. The patch format is a stripped-down, file-oriented
diff designed to be easy to parse and safe to apply. The envelope is:

*** Begin Patch
[ one or more file sections ]
*** End Patch

Each section starts with one of three headers:

*** Add File: <path>    — create a new file. Every following line is a + line.
*** Delete File: <path> — remove an existing file. Nothing follows.
*** Update File: <path> — patch an existing file (optionally with a rename).

An Update may be followed by *** Move to: <new path> to rename the file.
Then one or more hunks, each introduced by @@ (optionally followed by a scope header).

Within a hunk, each line starts with:
  (space) — context line (unchanged)
  -       — line to remove
  +       — line to add

Context rules:
- Show 3 lines of context above and below each change.
- If 3 lines are not enough to uniquely locate the hunk, add @@ scope headers:
  @@ class MyClass
  @@ def my_method():
  [3 context lines]
  - old_code
  + new_code
  [3 context lines]

Grammar:
Patch := Begin { FileOp } End
Begin := "*** Begin Patch" NEWLINE
End := "*** End Patch" NEWLINE
FileOp := AddFile | DeleteFile | UpdateFile
AddFile := "*** Add File: " path NEWLINE { "+" line NEWLINE }
DeleteFile := "*** Delete File: " path NEWLINE
UpdateFile := "*** Update File: " path NEWLINE [ MoveTo ] { Hunk }
MoveTo := "*** Move to: " newPath NEWLINE
Hunk := "@@" [ header ] NEWLINE { HunkLine } [ "*** End of File" NEWLINE ]
HunkLine := (" " | "-" | "+") text NEWLINE

Example combining all operations:

*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: hello.txt
+Hello world
*** Update File: src/app.py
*** Move to: src/main.py
@@ def greet():
-print("Hi")
+print("Hello, world!")
*** Delete File: obsolete.txt
*** End Patch

Important:
- Always include a header (Add/Delete/Update) for each file.
- Prefix every new line with + even when creating a new file.
- File paths must be relative, NEVER absolute.
- Do NOT use standard unified diff format (--- a/ +++ b/). Use only the format above.

- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to
  make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are
  auto-generated or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string
  across a codebase).
