# Description
Operate on a relative path in the bound personal or project memory wiki. Read a file from the filesystem. Returns line-numbered content for text files. For image files (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP), returns the image for visual inspection. For PDF files, returns the document for content analysis. When reading a PDF, put what you hope to learn in the `vision_prompt` argument — the system will provide a detailed description alongside the file. Reading MEMORY.md at the scope root returns the whole generated index.

# vision_prompt
PDF reads only: describe what factual data you need extracted and why. Vision is an OCR + description service, not an analyst. It will extract and describe what you ask for; interpretation and classification are your job. Concrete asks work best: transcribe, list, extract, locate.
